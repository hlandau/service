[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/gopkg.in/hlandau/service.v1?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/gopkg.in/hlandau/service.v1) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hlandau/service.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hlandau/service)

This package enables you to easily write services in Go such that the following concerns are taken care of automatically:

  - Daemonization
  - Fork emulation (not recommended, though)
  - PID file creation
  - Privilege dropping
  - Chrooting
  - Status notification (supports setproctitle and systemd notify protocol; this support is Go-native and does not introduce any dependency on any systemd library)
  - Operation as a Windows service
  - Orderly shutdown

Here's a usage example:

```go
import "gopkg.in/hlandau/service.v1"

func main() {
  service.Main(&service.Info{
      Title:       "Foobar Web Server",
      Name:        "foobar",
      Description: "Foobar Web Server is the greatest webserver ever.",

      RunFunc: func(smgr service.Manager) error {
          // Start up your service.
          // ...

          // Once initialization requiring root is done, call this.
          err := smgr.DropPrivileges()
          if err != nil {
              return err
          }

          // When it is ready to serve requests, call this.
          // You must call DropPrivileges first.
          smgr.SetStarted()

          // Optionally set a status.
          smgr.SetStatus("foobar: running ok")

          // Wait until stop is requested.
          <-smgr.StopChan()

          // Do any necessary teardown.
          // ...

          // Done.
          return nil
      },
  })
}
```

You should import the package as "gopkg.in/hlandau/service.v1". Compatibility will be preserved. (Please note that this compatibility guarantee does not extend to subpackages.)

Flags
-----

The following flags are automatically registered via the "flag" package:

    -chroot=path              (*nix only) chroot to a directory (must set UID, GID) ("/" disables)
    -daemon=0|1               (*nix only) run as daemon? (doesn't fork)
                                (remaps stdin, stdout, stderr to /dev/null; calls setsid)
    -dropprivs=0|1            (*nix only) drop privileges?
    -fork=0|1                 (*nix only) fork?
    -uid=username             (*nix only) UID or username to setuid to
    -gid=groupname            (*nix only) GID or group name to setgid to
    -pidfile=path             (*nix only) Path of PID file to write and lock (default: no PID file)
    -cpuprofile=path          Write CPU profile to file
    -debugserveraddr=ip:port  Bind the net/http DefaultServeMux to the given address
                              (expvars, pprof handlers will be registered; intended for debug use only;
                               set UsesDefaultHTTP in the Info type to disable the presence of this flag)
    -service=start|stop|install|remove  (Windows only) Service control.

Using as a Windows service
--------------------------

You can use the `-service=install` and `-service=remove` flags to install and
remove the service as a Windows service. Please note that:

  - You will need to run these commands from an elevated command prompt
    (right click on 'Command Prompt' and select 'Run as administrator').

  - The absolute path of the executable in its current location will be used
    as the path to the service.

  - You may need to tweak the command line arguments for the service
    to your liking using `services.msc` after installation.

  - You may also use any other method that you like to install or remove
    services. No particular command line flag is required; the service will
    detect when it is being run as a Windows service automatically.

### Manifests

If your service *always* needs to run privileged, you may want to apply a manifest file to your binary to make elevation automatic. You should avoid this if your service can be configured to usefully operate without elevation, as it denies the user choice in how to run the service.

Here is an example manifest:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<assembly xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1" manifestVersion="1.0">
    <trustInfo xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v2">
        <security>
            <requestedPrivileges>
                <requestedExecutionLevel 
                     level="requireAdministrator" 
                     uiAccess="false"/>
            </requestedPrivileges>
        </security>
    </trustInfo>
</assembly>
```

You can use this manifest either as a sidecar file by naming it `<exe-name>.exe.manifest`, or by embedding it into the binary. You may wish to investigate Microsoft's `mt` tool or [akavel/rsrc](https://github.com/akavel/rsrc), which provides a Go-specific solution.

For more information on manifests, see MSDN.

Use with systemd
----------------

Here is an example systemd unit file with privilege dropping and auto-restart:

    [Unit]
    Description=short description of the daemon
    ;; Optionally make the service dependent on other services
    ;Requires=other.service

    [Service]
    Type=notify
    ExecStart=/path/to/foobar/foobard -uid=foobar -gid=foobar -daemon
    Restart=always
    RestartSec=30

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target

Bugs
----

  - This library has to call flag.Parse() to figure out what to do before it
    calls your code. It uses a separate flagset to do this, because it seems
    impolite to call flag.Parse() twice. This flagset is unaware of any flags
    used by the application. Thus, if an application flag is passed, a parse
    error occurs. Because of this, you must pass any flags used by this
    library before any flags used by your application.

  - Testing would be nice, but a library of this nature isn't too susceptible
    to unit testing. Something to think about.

  - **Severe**: A bug in Go 1.5 means that privilege dropping does not work correctly, but instead hangs forever ([#12498](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/12498)). A patch is available but is not yet part of any release. As a workaround, use Go 1.4 or do not use privilege dropping (e.g. run as a non-root user and do not specify `-uid`, `-gid` or `-chroot`). If you need to bind to low ports, you can use `setcap` on Linux to grant those privileges. (This bug will be fixed in Go 1.5.2.)

Platform Support
----------------

This package should work on Windows or any UNIX-like platform, but it is currently
tested only on Windows, Linux and Darwin/OS X.

On Linux **you may need to install the libcap development package** (`libcap-dev` on Debian-style distros, `libcap-devel` on RedHat-style distros), as this package uses libcap to make sure all capabilities are dropped on Linux.
